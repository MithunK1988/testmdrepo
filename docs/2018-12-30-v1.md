I am pleased to announce the release of mdoc v1.0.0. mdoc is a markdown
documentation tool for Scala inspired by [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut).

## New website

The mdoc readme has been replaced with this website and the documentation has
been expanded to cover mdoc features in more depth. There is a new
["Coming from tut"](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/docs/tut.html) guide to help tut
users migrate to mdoc.

## New sbt plugin

There is now an sbt-mdoc plugin that makes it easier to use mdoc from sbt
builds. See the
[installation instructions](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/docs/installation.html#sbt)
to learn how to use sbt-mdoc.

## Docusaurus integration

The sbt-mdoc plugin includes a `DocusaurusPlugin` to integrate mdoc with
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Several projects already use mdoc in
combination with Docusaurus:

- [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/)
- [Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/)
- [Scalameta](http://scalameta.org/)
- [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/)
- [Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/)
- [Coursier](https://coursier.github.io/coursier/)
- [Almond](http://almond-sh.github.io/almond/stable/docs/intro)
- [fs2-kafka](https://ovotech.github.io/fs2-kafka/)

See the
[docusaurus instructions](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/docs/installation.html#sbt)
to learn how to use `DocusaurusPlugin` and configure CI to publish to GitHub
pages.

## Improved `:fail` modifier

Previously, mdoc used Scala macros to implement the `:fail` modifier which
produces incorrect compilation errors in rare cases. See
[#95](https://github.com/olafurpg/mdoc/issues/95). Now, mdoc translates each
`:fail` modifier into a standalone Scala program and compiles it with the Scala
compiler ensuring that compile errors are always accurate.

## New `:reset` modifier

Now it's possible to clear all leading imports and declarations in the markdown
document with the
[`mdoc:reset`](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/docs/modifiers.html#reset) modifier.

## New organization

Previously, the mdoc repository lived in olafurpg/mdoc and was published under
`com.geirsson`. Now, mdoc lives in scalameta/mdoc and is published under
`org.scalameta`.
