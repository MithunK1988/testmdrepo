## Compile-only modifier

The new `compile-only` modifier makes it possible to validate that a
code-example compiles successfully without evaluating the program at runtime.
This feature can be useful to demonstrate code that performs side-effects

```scala
val name = scala.io.StdIn.readLine("Please enter your name: ")
```

The `compile-only` modifier works for both for JVM and Scala.js code blocks.
