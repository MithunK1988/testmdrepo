## Interactive documentation with Scala.js

You can now write `mdoc:js` code fences that compile with Scala.js and evaluate
as JavaScript in the browser. This features is great for Scala.js libraries to
write interactive documentation. To learn more, see the
[documentation](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/docs/js.html).

## No spurious `-Ywarn-discard-value` warnings

He mdoc generated code previously reported a warning when compiled with the
`-Ywarn-discard-value` option. Now, the generated code no longer reports
warnings.

## Clearer error messages for generated code

Previously, errors in generated mdoc code only reported the message without a
position making it difficult to track down the problem. Now, errors in generated
code show the generated code making it easier to see what's going on.

Before:

```scala
error: object scalajs is not a member of package org
```

After:

```scala
error: readme.md:3 (mdoc generated code) object scalajs is not a member of package org
def run0(node: _root_.org.scalajs.dom.raw.Element): Unit = {
                           ^
```

## --out cannot be subdirectory of --in

It is no longer possible to make `--out` a subdirectory of `--in` to prevent the
number of files for mdoc to process to grow exponentially. Previously, this
situation could silently happen with mis-configuration in the build but now mdoc
fails fast when it happens.

## Build sbt-mdoc against sbt 1.0.0

The sbt-mdoc plugin is now compiled against sbt 1.0.0 to avoid binary
compatibility issues.
